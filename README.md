## üìî Introduction

Newcar is a Highly configurable universal advanced engine, 2Born for creating animation rapidly. You can use it in a lot of jobs, such as the **video clips**, **dynamic chart** (In the future) and even **2D game development** (Also in the future).

## üåü Feature

- Rich API interfaces üõ†Ô∏è: Powerful and diverse APIs that provide greater freedom in creating animations.
- Based on the native Canvas API üß¨: Based on HTML Canvas, it facilitates the development of graphic functionalities. In the future, we will use some ways to improve the performance of Newcar.
- High degree of customization ‚öôÔ∏è: Strong customizability, allowing for the creation of one's own animation style.

## üîñ Example

To create a animation by Newcar, we firstly need a animation object --- `Car`.

Via `newcar` to create a animation.

```javascript
import * as $ from "newcar";

const animation = $.newcar("#canvas");
```

And then, we need to create a scene for the animation and check out to it.

```javascript
const scene = $.scene([], []);
animation.scene = scene;
```

The last step is playing it!

```javascript
animation.play();
```

Now, the animation has been ran, in the following docs, we'll let it do something absorbing.

Newcar offers many objects so that you have more choice (We have basic lib and some offical mods, please refer to API Docs.) In this instance, we use `Text` as a example.There are two ways to add objects.

```javascript
// First way
const scene = $.scene([new $.Text("Hello world!")], []);

// Second way
scene.add(new $.Text("Hello world!"));
```

If everything is okay, you may see a text object with "Hello world" appears on the canvas.

Let's talk about the callback function per frame. As the word, the function will be called in each frame, and it allow user getting the current time through a parameter.

There are also two ways to set the callback function.

```javascript
// First way
const scene = $.scene(
  [],
  [
    (time) => {
      // ...
    }
  ]
);

// Second way
scene.update((time) => {
  // ...
});
```

We need to use `animate()` to animate the object. The first parameter is the type of animations, the second is the holding time of animation, and the finally is more parameters.

```javascript
scene.update((time) => {
  text.animate($.moveTo, 1, {
    x: 300,
    y: 300
  });
});
```

These codes will let the text move to (300, 300) during 1 second.


## üß≠ Future Plans

- Add plugin system for the project, and make it has more flexibility.
- Add charts module, to make the dynamic data animation.
- Add skeleton module, let's make some animation!
- Add event system to be a interactive animation engine.
- Add UI.
- Add physical engine for objects.
- Use WebGL instead of Canvas2D.
