# Chart Module

## Introduction

Newcar provides a set of officially maintained chart component libraries, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, and other types of charts, which can meet the needs of various data visualizations.

The chart module can be introduced through the `@newcar/mod-chart` package, and the specific API can be found in the [API documentation](https://apis.newcarjs.org/modules/_newcar_mod_chart.html).

Next, we will briefly introduce the use of the chart module from the basic concepts and the use of several common charts.
